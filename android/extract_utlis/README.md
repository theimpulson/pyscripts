Extract-utlis's python implementation
-------------------------------------

A WIP LineageOS's extract-utlis's python3 implementation. As of now, it can generate dummy directories, files and do the initial setup.


#### To-Do:

- Support various given arguments for source
- Detect file system scheme (legacy, sys-as-root, etc) for copying files from proper path
- Implement threading if possible to speed up copying, deodexing and other work
- Implement deodexing of apks and jars
